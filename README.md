# Tic Tac Toe Game
A simple tic tac toe game where a user plays one round against a computer. Whether the computer or user goes first is randomized. Each square on the board corresponds with a unique number between 1 and 9 inclusive.
The user must enter the number of an empty square to place their marker. 

EDIT: I have now introduced additional functionality. The results of each game and the games themselves shall be saved to a file along with the total number of wins of both the user and the computer and the total number of draws as well. In addition, the user can now choose between 3 actions which are to view the score board, play a game against the computer, or to view the results of a game
